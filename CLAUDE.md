- Do not add comments.
- The Rust 2024 Edition is now stable
- Do not add code that silently skips over unhappy paths. Be explicit!
- Use the .me/ git-ignored folder for your test files (.me/TestSample.V21 is a real CWR file for reference)
- Logging: Use `log` crate with appropriate levels (info, warn, error). To see logs, set RUST_LOG=info (or debug) when running
- Never change tests to match what the code does. Always ask the user what the right answer should be!
- Thou shall not write Rust code that panics!
- This app is designed for huge files. We need to stream, avoid allocating increasing amounts of memory.
- Follow SOLID principles, use liberal modularization with Rust modules
