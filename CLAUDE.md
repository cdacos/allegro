- Do not add comments.
- The Rust 2024 Edition is now stable
- Do not add code that silently skips over unhappy paths. Be explicit!
- When writing CWR tests always take exact examples from the file .me/TestSample.V21 (.me/ is gitignored in project root)
- Logging: Use `log` crate with appropriate levels (info, warn, error). To see logs, set RUST_LOG=info (or debug) when running
- Never change tests to match what the code does. Always ask the user what the right answer should be!
