- Minimal comments - only for non-obvious business rules that would surprise a domain-familiar developer
- Rust 2024 Edition
- Explicit error handling, no silent failures
- Use .me/ folder for test files (with real CWR sample)
- Use log crate for logging
- Don't change tests to match code - ask for correct behavior
- No panicking code
- Stream processing for huge files, avoid memory allocation growth
- SOLID principles with liberal Rust modularization
- After a working code change run cargo fmt & cargo clippy
- CWR spec is slow moving, records do not change frequently
